The notebook is what makes Senter valuable as an **auxiliary to Hermes
Agent**. It's a structured state object that flows between turns, between
agents, and across process boundaries. It's what the 256K context window
is *for*. It's how the agent gets "proactive awareness" — detecting that
the user is doing something related to a past event and offering context.

This post is the spec.

## The problem (and why text-only memory isn't enough)

A user starts asking a question via voice, then switches to typing, then opens a screenshot. Standard text-only memory: three siloed traces that may or may not be linked. The agent loses the thread when the user switches modalities.

The notebook solves this by encoding every moment as a **structured multi-sensory artifact** — text + audio signature + image signature + concepts + links — that the agent can retrieve by *any* modality, not just text. This is the [Synthesia](./the-synthesia-layer.md) idea applied to the agent's working memory.

## The schema

A notebook is a directory of YAML files. One file per session, one entry per significant moment. Plus a global index for cross-session retrieval.

```yaml
# ~/.senter/notebook/sessions/<session_id>.yaml
notebook:
  schema_version: "1.0"
  session_id: "s_2026-06-07_001"
  created_at: "2026-06-07T18:30:14Z"
  last_touched: "2026-06-07T19:14:23Z"
  owner: "chris@sovthpaw"
  
  # === TOP-LEVEL TASK ===
  task: "user wants a 2min music video for their band"
  task_status: "in_progress"  # pending | in_progress | blocked | done
  
  # === CURRENT CONTEXT (curated, fits in 256K) ===
  context:
    raw_history_size_tokens: 4823
    condensed_history: |
      User is working on a music video. Asked for a 2min song with their lyrics.
      Previous turn: chose indie-pop genre, gave lyrics draft.
    
    # The 3 most recent moments (always included in context)
    recent_moments:
      - moment_id: "m_1829"
        timestamp: "2026-06-07T19:12:01Z"
        text: "user approved the chorus melody"
        audio_signature_hash: "a3f2b1..."
        image_signature_hash: "i8e4d2..."
      - moment_id: "m_1830"
        timestamp: "2026-06-07T19:13:45Z"

  # === DECISIONS (full audit log) ===

      moment_id: "m_1810"
    - turn: 4

      moment_id: "m_1829"
  
  # === PENDING (open threads) ===
  pending:
    - "needs final lyrics from user"
    - "needs to confirm video export settings"
  
  # === ESCALATIONS (Hermes handoffs) ===

      moment_id: "m_1825"
  
  # === LINKS (cross-references to other sessions/moments) ===
  links:
    - "moments/m_0042.yaml"  # the moment from yesterday where we discussed the band

Each moment is a separate file:

## The write/read API

The notebook manager is a Python module that the Senter runtime imports. It exposes a clean API:

```python
from notebook_manager import Notebook

nb = Notebook(owner="chris@sovthpaw")

# === WRITE ===
moment_id = nb.add_moment(
    text="user approved the chorus melody",
    audio_signature=audio_emb,  # 512-d torch.Tensor
    image_signature=image_emb,  # 512-d torch.Tensor
    multimodal_embedding=joint_emb,  # 4096-d torch.Tensor
    concepts=["music", "chorus", "approval"],
    audio_clip_path="~/.senter/notebook/audio/m_1829.wav",
    image_clip_path="~/.senter/notebook/images/m_1829.png",
)

nb.add_decision(turn=5, what="user changed tempo", moment_id=moment_id)
nb.add_escalation(to="hermes-4", reason="complex chord progression", 
                  notebook_at_handoff_kb=52, response_summary="use I-vi-IV-V")

# === READ (cross-modal retrieval) ===
# Text query
results = nb.query("chorus melody approval", top_k=5)
# Returns: list of Moment objects, sorted by relevance

# Audio query (find moments that sound like this)
results = nb.query_by_audio(audio_emb, top_k=5)

# Image query (find moments that look like this)
results = nb.query_by_image(image_emb, top_k=5)

# Cross-modal query (sound + image + text)
results = nb.query_multimodal(
    text="cooking",
    audio_emb=kitchen_sound_emb,
    image_emb=pasta_image_emb,
    top_k=5,
)

# === COMPACTION (periodic) ===
nb.compact()  # summarize old moments, decay importance scores
```

## The compaction policy (when does a "moment" become a "memory"?)

The notebook can't grow forever. The compaction policy decides what stays detailed and what gets summarized:

| Age | Action |
|---|---|
| 0-7 days | Keep full fidelity (text + audio + image) |
| 7-30 days | Decay `importance`; moments with `importance < 0.3` get summarized into a "week summary" entry |
| 30-90 days | Daily entries collapse into weekly summaries |
| 90+ days | Weekly summaries collapse into monthly summaries; the original moment file is archived to cold storage |
| Never (concepts) | Concept indices (e.g., "music", "work-senter") persist forever, but the detail degrades |

The LLM does the summarization — Senter itself summarizes its own old moments. The summary is itself a new moment, with a `parent_moment` link to the originals.

## The privacy model

The notebook captures everything — audio signatures, image signatures, full text. Three privacy controls:

1. **Owner-only by default** — files are chmod 600, in `~/.senter/`
2. **Per-modality opt-out** — `~/.senter/config.yaml` can disable audio/indexing, image/indexing, etc.
3. **Manual redaction** — `nb.redact(moment_id)` removes the audio/image but keeps the text; `nb.forget(concept)` removes all moments tagged with that concept
4. **Encrypted-at-rest** — the audio/image signatures can be encrypted with the owner's key (optional, off by default for performance)

The Synthesia indexer is *passive and local* — it never uploads anything. The notebook is the user's private data, on the user's machine.

## The "how this helps" summary (the 10 benefits)

For the full "how does this help us" list, see [synthesia.md](./the-synthesia-layer.md). The headline wins:

1. **Better memory retrieval** — recall by sound, image, or text
2. **True continuity** — voice → text → screenshot, one thread
3. **Proactive awareness** — the agent notices relevant past events
4. **Richer Hermes context** — escalation passes a multimodal snapshot
5. **Continuous life-log** — every 30s, a moment gets stamped
6. **Cross-modal training signal** — the stream IS training data
7. **Dimensional memory** — multimodal embeddings have more "slots"
8. **Reduced forgetting** — same memory indexed by all modalities
9. **Multi-sensory artifact** — the notebook feels like a real memory
10. **Fused expert** — the synesthesia expert is both multimodal AND agentic

## Implementation status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Schema (this doc) | ✅ defined |
| YAML serialization | ⏳ to implement (PyYAML) |
| FAISS embedding index | ⏳ to implement (faiss-cpu) |
| Cross-modal retrieval | ⏳ to implement (the Synesthesia expert in the MoE) |
| Compaction policy | ⏳ to implement (LLM-summarize on cron) |
| Privacy controls | ⏳ to implement (chmod, opt-out flags) |
| Hermes integration | ⏳ via `auxiliary_client.py` (already exists in hermes-agent) |

Estimated code: 400-600 lines of Python for the manager + 200 lines for the Synesthesia expert. Builds on existing `faiss-cpu`, `pyyaml`, `torch` (all already in the env).
