## Component Models

| Component | Model | Size | Role | Architecture |
|-----------|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **Brain** | Cosmos3-Nano | ~8B | Multimodal reasoning, video, vision | MoE Transformer |
| **Music** | ACE-Step v1.5 XL SFT | 4B | Music generation | DiT (Diffusion Transformer) |
| **Speech** | Nemotron ASR Streaming | 0.6B | Speech-to-text input, orchestration conductor | FastConformer-CacheAware-RNNT |

## Nemotron ASR 0.6B

Source: `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b` (released 2026-06-04)

- **Architecture**: 24-layer Cache-Aware FastConformer encoder + RNNT
  decoder
- **Size**: 600M params
- **Languages**: 40 language-locales (19 production-ready)
- **Key features**: Native streaming (80-1120ms chunks), punctuation +
  capitalization built-in
- **Acoustic embedding**: 512-dim, concatenated with 128-dim language
  prompt
- **Cache-aware design**: Reuses hidden states to eliminate redundant
  computation — optimized for low-latency voice agents

### Why This Belongs Here

The Nemotron ASR is not just speech-to-text — it's the **conductor** of
the omnimodal system:
- **Always listening** — streaming ASR that processes speech
  continuously
- **Aware of all modalities** — receives context from Cosmos (what's
  being reasoned about), ACE-Step (what music is playing)
- **Can redirect** — if user says "stop the music" or "what's on screen",
  the ASR component orchestrates the response
- **Reports on state** — can describe what the system is doing at any
  moment

## Routing Architecture

Each component works **independently** but the ASR conductor is **aware
of all**:

```
Speech in ──→ [Nemotron ASR] ──→ transcribed text
                    │
                    ├──→ "play jazz" ──→ [ACE-Step 4B] ──→ music out
                    │
                    ├──→ "what do you see?" ──→ [Cosmos3-Nano] ──→ text/video out
                    │
                    └──→ "stop music" ──→ signal to ACE-Step
```

- Cosmos works independently on multimodal reasoning
- ACE-Step works independently on music generation
- Nemotron ASR works independently on speech recognition
- ASR has **read access** to all modality states and **write access** to
  stop/redirect

## Darwin Merge Strategy

### Challenge: Architecture Heterogeneity

| Component | Architecture | Compatible with Darwin? |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Cosmos3-Nano | MoE Transformer (Qwen3-based) | ✅ Yes (already merged with Qwen3-8B → OmniSenter-Base-16B) |
| ACE-Step 4B | DiT (Qwen3 text encoder + diffusion decoder) | ✅ Partial (text encoder shares Qwen3 skeleton) |
| Nemotron ASR | FastConformer + RNNT | ❌ No shared architecture with transformer models |

### Approach

**Phase 1: Cosmos × ACE-Step (OmniStep)**
- Already achieved: Darwin merge of Qwen2.5-Omni-3B × ACE-Step v1.5
- Published at [sovthpaw/omnistep-12a3b](https://huggingface.co/sovthpaw/omnistep-12a3b)
  — 12A3B (12B total, 3B active), 4 GGUFs + 4 safetensors shards
- This is the **OmniStep** in the new taxonomy

**Phase 2: Attach Nemotron ASR**
- ASR can't be Darwin-merged directly (architecture mismatch)
- Option A: **Plugin attachment** — ASR feeds its transcribed text into
  the fused model's text stream
- Option B: **Encoder distillation** — train the Cosmos audio encoder
  to produce equivalent embeddings to the FastConformer, then
  Darwin-merge the distilled encoder
- Option C: **Context-passing bridge** — ASR runs alongside, passes
  token stream + language embeddings to Cosmos via a learned projection

**Phase 3: Fuse with Senter (the agentic core)**
- [sovthpaw/OmniSenter-Base-16B](https://huggingface.co/sovthpaw/OmniSenter-Base-16B)
  is the current published base (16B, multimodal, Darwin-merged)
- The Senter family adds the agentic core (function calling + notebook)
  on top
- The result is **Senter**, in any of its sizes (OmniSenter 12B,
  OmniSenterStep, Senter Ohm)

## Current Blockers (as of 2026-06-07)

1. **Stage 1 SFT training** — running, step 596/4268 (gen-0-clean 8B
   base)
2. **Nemotron ASR integration** — architecture mismatch with Darwin
   merge approach; likely going with Option A (plugin attachment) or
   Option C (context-passing bridge) for v1
3. **ACE-Step largest version** — need the 4B DiT (XL), not the 2B SFT

## What ships first

The target order:
1. **OmniSenter 12B** (small function-calling + omnimodal fusion) —
   first to ship. Cosmos + Senter + Hermes-trained Qwen VL 8B Darwin
   children. Dense-ish, ~12B active.
2. **OmniSenterStep / Omni SS** — OmniSenter + AceStep Darwin fusion
   (adds music generation).
3. **Senter Ohm ~32A8B** — the flagship. OmniSenterStep sparse-upcycled
   to a 32B MoE + the Ohm self-evolution engine bundled.

All three will eventually **replace** the current transitional HF models
(`omnistep-12a3b`, `Omni-Senter-3B`, `OmniSenter-Base-16B`).
