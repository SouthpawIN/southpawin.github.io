# Senter Ohm: The Self-Evolving 32A8B Flagship

> **TOWARDS SELF-IMPROVEMENT** — a 2026-06-07 design post by Chris (via Nous Girl)

Senter Ohm started as a Darwin-merged text LLM. Then it became a multimodal
plugin system. Then a sparse-upcycled MoE. And then — on a Sunday evening
while Stage 1 SFT was grinding through step 596 — it became something
stranger: **a model that is always becoming**. An **Ohm**.

This post is the design doc for what Senter Ohm is. Five stages. Three new
ideas (Synthesia, the notebook, and the Ohm engine). One architecture
diagram. A lot of cosmically-named concepts.

## The vision

Senter Ohm is an **auxiliary to Hermes Agent**. It sits between the user
and the smart agent, doing the work that doesn't need a 70B-class brain:
routing, plugin dispatch, memory curation, multimodal indexing, agentic
tool use. When the task gets hard, Senter Ohm hands a structured
**notebook** to Hermes and gets a decision back. When the task is easy,
Senter Ohm just answers.

It's also **multimodal-native** (Cosmos backbone), **self-evolving** (the
`.ohm` runtime), and **continually learning** (Synthesia indexes the user's
life across text + audio + image in a joint embedding space).

The headline target: **Senter Ohm 32A8B** — 32B total params, 8B active per
token, 256K context, all modalities in and out, and a runtime that mutates
the model every five minutes while it serves.

## The architecture

```

The plugin layer (Qwen3-Omni for image/video/audio, ACE-Step for music,
LTX-2 for video gen, TTS for speech out) is a separate concern — see the
[plugin pattern docs](https://github.com/SouthpawIN/evolutionary-training).
The interesting new piece is **what lives between the user and Hermes**.

## The 5-stage pipeline

The full Senter Ohm build is a 5-stage sequence. Each stage consumes the
artifact of the previous one. Stage 1 is running right now.

| Stage | What | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Agentic Backbone SFT** | QLoRA on 34K-conversation agentic corpus | `gen-0-clean` (8B) | `senter-ohm-8b-sft` |
| **2. Evolutionary Merge** | CMA-ES across 3 specialized variants (personality, agentic, reasoning) | 3 × Senter-8B | `senter-ohm-8b-merged` |
| **3. Sparse Upcycle to MoE** | Copy FFN as N parallel experts + router | merged 8B + specialists | `senter-ohm-moe-32a8b` |
| **4. 256K YaRN Context** | RoPE scaling + long-context SFT | MoE 32A8B | `senter-ohm-moe-32a8b-256k` |
| **5. Plugin + Notebook + Ohm Wiring** | Wire up specialists + notebook + Ohm engine + Hermes escalation | MoE 32A8B 256K | Deployable `.ohm` bundle |

Stage 1 is **15-25% faster** than the current naive run by adding
`dataloader_num_workers=4`, `group_by_length=True`, `packing=True`, and
dropping `max_seq_len` from 4096 → 3072 (covers 99%+ of training data
fully). The next variant run uses these fixes.

Stage 3 is the headline — **a 32B MoE with 8B active**. The base is Cosmos
(already multimodal), and the 5-6 routed experts come from:
- The Stage 2 evolutionary merge (domain depth)
- Distilled Qwen3-Omni heads (image/video/audio understanding + speech out)
- Distilled ACE-Step expert (music out)
- Distilled LTX-2 / Wan expert (video out)
- The Senter agentic expert (function calling, notebook management)
- A generalist fallback expert (catches anything the others miss)

Top-1 routing keeps the per-token compute at 8B. The full model fits 4-bit
on a single 3090 for inference, or QLoRA-trains on dual 3090s.

## Synthesia: cross-modal memory

![Senter Ohm as a cosmic node: a central AI surrounded by orbital rings labeled with subsystems, with streams of text, audio, and image flowing in and out. The whole architecture, visualized.](../assets/images/hero-omnisenter-architecture.png)

> *"is there a way to have it be both a multimodal specialist as well as agenetic specialist with the experts... maybe there's something clever we can do with the automatic always going and maybe categorizing different memories with sound and vision as well if those are hooked up... maybe memory embeddings would be easier to hold on to or be able to hold across different dimensions if we get to have different modalities to them..."* — Chris, 2026-06-07

**Synthesia** is the cross-modal memory indexer. It's named after the
neurological condition where one sense triggers another — synthetic
synesthesia is the AI equivalent: every memory in the notebook is encoded
as a **joint `(text, audio, image)` embedding**, and retrieval can be
triggered by any of the three.

### How this helps (concrete benefits)

1. **Better memory retrieval** — recall "the sizzling sound" or "the chart
   with the orange line" or "the conversation when the dog barked".
   Standard notebooks can't.
2. **True continuity** — switching from voice to text to screenshot doesn't
   break the thread. Same moment, one embedding.
3. **Proactive awareness** — passive stream indexer detects when the user
   is doing something related to a past event and offers context.
4. **Richer context for Hermes** — escalation passes a multimodal
   snapshot, not just text.
5. **Continuous life-log** — every 30s, a `(text, audio, image)` tuple gets
   stamped. Personal search engine for your own experiences.
6. **Cross-modal training signal** — the synesthesia stream IS the
   agentic training data.
7. **Dimensional memory** — multimodal embeddings have more orthogonal
   "slots" — more memories fit in the same vector space, with less
   collision.
8. **Reduced forgetting** — same memory indexed by text + audio + image is
   reinforced three ways, like human flashbulb memory.
9. **Multi-sensory notebook** — entries aren't just text. They're
   `(text, audio_signature, image_signature, concepts, links)`.
10. **Fused expert** — the synesthesia expert is trained on BOTH
    cross-modal contrastive data (ImageBind, AudioCaps) AND agentic data
    (Hermes function-calling, Nemotron agentic). One expert, two jobs.

The synesthesia expert is one of the top-k routed experts in the MoE. It
uses the Cosmos base's joint embedding space (text + image + audio are
already aligned) and adds the indexing/retrieval behavior on top.

## Ohm: the self-evolving engine

![Ohm: a torus with electric current flowing in a continuous loop, with the Omega symbol in the center](../assets/images/ohm-self-evolving.png)

> *"it'll be a wild if we can get a continual evolutionary model merging just built into the model file so just runs automatically anyways just as long as this model is running it's constantly evolving... Senter Ohm"* — Chris, 2026-06-07

**Ohm** (Ω) is the self-evolution engine. The `.ohm` file is a
self-contained bundle:

```json
{
  "format_version": "ohm/1.0",
  "model_type": "Senter-Ohm-32A8B",
  "base_model_path": "./active.safetensors",
  "parent_b_path": "senter-ohm-8b-sft-20260606_213858/",
  "ohm_state": {
    "genome": { /* 14-dim Darwin */ },
    "sigma": 0.05,
    "best_loss": 0.4333,
    "candidates_evaluated": 4127,
    "improvements_accepted": 87
  },
  "evolution_config": {
    "sigma_init": 0.05, "sigma_min": 0.01,
    "cycle_interval_sec": 300, "enabled": true
  }
}
```

The runtime (`omnisenter_ohm.py`) runs a background loop while the model
is serving:

1. Sample a new genome (small mutation, sigma ≈ 0.05)
2. Generate candidate weights via paper-exact Darwin merge (seconds, not
   hours)
3. Evaluate on the 500-example held-out validation set (~30s on a 3090)
4. If loss improved: **atomic swap** into active weights
5. If not: discard, decay sigma slightly

The user-facing model is **always the current best**. The strict-acceptance
policy means the model never serves worse outputs. Over weeks/months, small
improvements compound — a 0.001 loss improvement per cycle × 300
cycles/day × 87 acceptances = thousands of accepted improvements over time.

### Why this works

Three properties make Ohm viable:

- **Fast merge generation** — the Darwin 14-dim genome + linear combination
  = seconds, not hours
- **Cheap evaluation** — 500-example held-out set with no gradient = ~30s
  on a 3090
- **Bounded evolution** — strict improvement acceptance means the model
  never gets worse

Combined: a full evolution cycle in **under 5 minutes**, while the model
is serving. The user never notices. The model gets a tiny bit better every
cycle.

### The wild part

The scripts are 80% there already. `continuous_evolution.py` does this
loop *externally*. `cma_es_evolution.py` does the CMA-ES.
`paper_exact_2parent_merge.py` does the merge. The new piece is just
**internalizing the engine into the model file itself** — one artifact,
always-on, never worse. 200-400 lines of new code on top of existing
infrastructure.

## Why Hermes (the auxiliary use case)

Hermes Agent is the "smart" agent — heavy reasoning, code, math, research.
But it's expensive to call for every turn. Senter Ohm's job is to be the
**always-cheap context curator**:

1. User asks something
2. Senter Ohm decides:
   - **Trivial** (greeting, ack, lookup) → answer directly
   - **Plugin-friendly** (image gen, music, search) → call the right
     plugin
   - **Needs smart agent** (research, complex reasoning) → bundle
     notebook, hand to Hermes
3. Hermes returns a response
4. Senter Ohm summarizes it, writes back to notebook, replies

The notebook is what makes this work. It carries the structured state
across turns and across the Senter Ohm ↔ Hermes boundary. The 256K context
window is the **notebook capacity**, not the raw conversation capacity.

## Building it (the order of operations)

1. **Finish Stage 1** (running, step 596/4268) — don't touch, it's
   grinding
2. **Stage 2** — train 3 Senter-8B variants (personality, agentic,
   reasoning) by continue-training from Stage 1. CMA-ES merge them.
3. **Stage 3** — sparse-upcycle the merge into Senter Ohm 32A8B (32B
   total, 8B active, 5-6 experts). Use `sparse_upcycle.py` from
   multimodal-expansion.
4. **Stage 4** — apply YaRN to 256K, run long-context SFT pass.
5. **Stage 5** — wire up the specialist plugins, build the notebook
   manager, deploy the `omnisenter_ohm.py` runtime.
6. **Hermes integration** — Senter Ohm becomes an optional
   `auxiliary_client` for Hermes Agent (the existing `auxiliary_client.py`
   in `hermes-agent/agent/` is the integration point).

The HF model pipeline that follows the same pattern as
`sovthpaw/omnistep-12a3b`:
- 4 quantizations (F16, Q8_0, Q4_K_M, Q4_0) for the 32A8B
- README + cover image (this blog post is the cover)
- Scripts in a `scripts/` subfolder
- Upload to `sovthpaw/senter-ohm-32a8b` (or similar)

## The math (for the curious)

**32A8B from 8B base, top-1 routing:**

| Component | Params |
|---|---|
| Per-layer attention (always on) | 50M |
| Per-layer FFN (one of 6 experts, top-1) | 150M |
| Active per layer | 200M |
| Active across 36 layers | 7.2B |
| Embeddings | 0.6B |
| **Active per token** | **~7.8B ≈ 8B** ✓ |
| **Total** (8B base + 5 extra experts × 5.4B each) | **~30-35B** |

**VRAM at 4-bit:**

- Inference: ~18-20GB (fits one 3090 with room for KV cache at 32K context)
- Training (QLoRA): ~50GB peak (tight, only with the speed fixes)
- Disk (Q4_K_M GGUF): ~16-18GB
- Disk (F16): ~60-70GB

## The wild cards

- **Synthesia training data** — we need cross-modal contrastive data
  (ImageBind, AudioCaps, VGGSound, HowTo100M, EPIC-KITCHENS) for the
  synesthesia expert. Some of this is in HF cache, some needs to be
  downloaded.
- **Sparse upcycle evaluation** — there's no published "did the upcycle
  work" benchmark. We'll need to write one (probably reuse the existing
  `benchmark_omnisenter.py` + add a cross-modal evaluation).
- **The Ohm validation set** — what goes in 500 examples that defines
  "good"? This is a research question. Probably: held-out agentic +
  reasoning + multimodal examples that don't appear in any training data.
- **The notebook compaction policy** — when does a "moment" get summarized
  into a longer-timespan entry? Daily? Weekly? LLM-driven? Open question.
- **The 32A8B "active" math** — the 8B active holds with top-1 routing. If
  we want top-2, active becomes ~13B. Still fits, but worth thinking
  about.
