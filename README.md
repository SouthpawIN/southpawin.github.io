# SouthpawIN — Personal Site

This repo is the front door for everything I build. It's deployed to
**https://southpawin.github.io/** via GitHub Pages.

## What's here

- **Blog** — long-form posts on the OmniSenter pipeline, the pet, the radio
- **Projects** — every repo, with descriptions and links
- **Models** — the curated catalog
- **Wiki** — the reference: every concept and entity, cross-linked

## How it works

- Source: Markdown in `docs/`
- Theme: MkDocs Material with custom Nous cosmic-variant CSS
- Build: GitHub Actions → `mkdocs build` → deploy to Pages
- Branch: `main`

## Local dev

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-rss-plugin mkdocs-minify-plugin pymdown-extensions
mkdocs serve
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.

## Adding a post

1. Add a new `.md` file under `docs/blog/`
2. Add an entry to `docs/blog/CATALOG.md` if you want it in the master index
3. Push to `main`
4. The site redeploys automatically
